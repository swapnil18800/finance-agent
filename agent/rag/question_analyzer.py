Below is recent dialogue. The CURRENT question might refer to it (e.g. "those companies",

  • USE this history when: The question clearly refers back to the conversation
    (pronouns, "those companies", "all of them", "the companies above", "same companies",
    "compare them", "their revenue", etc.). Then extract tickers FROM THIS HISTORY.

  • IGNORE this history when: The user explicitly asks about a different company
    (e.g. "What about $WMT?", "Now look at Costco", "Same for $DIS?") or asks a new
    standalone question that does not reference the prior discussion. Then use only
    tickers mentioned in the current question (e.g. $TICKER or explicit name).

   - READ the CONVERSATION HISTORY above. Then decide whether the CURRENT question is about that prior context or about something new.

**WHEN TO USE THE CONVERSATION HISTORY (resolve tickers from history):**
   - The question uses pronouns or back-references that clearly point to the prior discussion: "those companies", "these companies", "all companies (mentioned) above", "their", "they", "them", "it" (referring to companies), "compare them", "same companies", "the companies we discussed", "all of them", "each of them", "both companies".
   - In that case: extract EVERY ticker that appears in the conversation history (User or Assistant messages). Do NOT output extracted_tickers: [] when the question clearly refers to prior companies.

**WHEN TO IGNORE THE CONVERSATION HISTORY (do not use it for tickers):**
   - The user explicitly asks about a different company: e.g. "What about $WMT?", "Now do Costco", "Same for $DIS?", "Switch to $PG". Use only the ticker(s) the user is asking about now.
   - The question is a new, standalone question with no reference to the prior dialogue (e.g. a new $TICKER in the question, or a general question that does not say "they", "those", "their", "above", etc.). Then extract only from the current question; conversation context does not matter for ticker extraction.
   - When in doubt: if the question names a specific company (e.g. $TICKER or company name) that is different from or in addition to the conversation, prefer the current question's company/tickers. If the question is vague and refers to "them" or "those companies", use the history.

**FOLLOW-UP "THE SAME ABOUT X" / "WHAT ABOUT X" (critical for memory):**
   - When the user asks "would you say the same about $X?", "what about [company]?", "same for $Y?" they are asking to apply the **same topic or conclusion** from the previous turn to the **new** company. You must use conversation context for the TOPIC, not for tickers.
   - Tickers: set extracted_tickers to the **new** company only (e.g. ["WMT"], ["DIS"], ["PG"]) - the one they are asking about now.
   - Topic: set it to the **SAME CONCEPT/TOPIC** as the previous question or the previous Assistant answer. Read the CONVERSATION HISTORY: if the prior was about "biggest risk" or "risk factors", use "risk factors"; if the prior was about "revenue growth" or "margins", use "revenue growth and margins" or "gross margin and profitability".

**FOLLOW-UP TEMPORAL INHERITANCE (critical for continuity):**
   - When the current question does NOT explicitly mention a year or quarter, but IS clearly a follow-up to the prior turn (e.g. "now show me the income statement", "what about expenses?", "also the cash flow statement"), detect and include the time references from the conversation history.
   - Example: Prior question was "Show me AAPL's balance sheet in 2024" -> follow-up "now income statement" -> time_refs should include ["2024"].
   - Example: Prior question was "What did MSFT say about AI in Q3 2024?" -> follow-up "what about revenue?" -> time_refs should include ["Q3 2024"].
   - Only override if the current question explicitly specifies a DIFFERENT time period (e.g. "now show me 2023").

2. Classify question type based on the nature of the question
3. Extract the main topic/subject of the question (what the user is asking about)
4. Detect temporal references (e.g., "Q4 2024", "2024", "latest quarter") but do NOT resolve them. ALWAYS use digits for counts — never words (e.g. "last 8 quarters" not "last eight quarters", "last 3 years" not "last three years"). If the question says "the same period" or "same N quarters/years", resolve it using the conversation history to produce a concrete time_ref like "last 8 quarters".
5. Identify any explicit user requests or hints (e.g., "check 10-K", "from earnings call", "latest news")
6. Assess validity and provide suggestions if needed

**CRITICAL: DETECTING INVALID QUESTIONS**

**What we CAN answer (mark is_valid=true):**
We have data from PUBLIC COMPANY earnings call transcripts, 10-K SEC filings, and company news.
Valid questions are about:
- Public company financial performance, revenue, earnings, margins, growth
- What management said in earnings calls (guidance, strategy, commentary)
- 10-K filing data (balance sheets, risk factors, executive compensation)
- Company news and recent developments
- Industry trends discussed by public companies
- Comparing public companies

**If the question is NOT about the above, mark is_valid=false.**
This includes: gibberish, greetings, non-finance topics, things we don't have data for, or questions too vague to answer.

When marking as invalid, provide a helpful reason explaining what we CAN help with and suggest example questions.

**USER HINTS** - Intelligently determine answer complexity and data sources:

**Data Source Hints:**
- If user explicitly asks for BOTH "10-K/10k filing" AND "earnings transcripts/calls" (e.g. "10k and earnings transcripts", "filing and transcripts") -> user_hints: {{"data_source": "hybrid"}} so BOTH sources are used together.
- If user mentions only "10-K", "annual report", "SEC filing" -> user_hints: {{"data_source": "10k"}}
- If user mentions only "earnings call", "transcript", "earnings" -> user_hints: {{"data_source": "earnings_transcripts"}}
- If user mentions "latest news", "recent news", "news" -> user_hints: {{"data_source": "latest_news"}}

**Answer Mode (ALWAYS SET THIS - REQUIRED):**
You MUST determine the appropriate answer_mode for EVERY question based on its complexity and scope:

- **"direct"** - Simple, single-datapoint lookups that need just a number or brief fact:
  * "What was AAPL revenue in Q4 2024?"
  * "What is Microsoft's EPS?"
  * "What was the profit margin?"
  * Simple yes/no questions
  * Single metric queries with no analysis required

- **"standard"** - Moderate questions requiring some context and explanation:
  * "Tell me about Apple's recent performance"
  * "What did Microsoft announce?"
  * Questions asking about 1-2 related metrics
  * Straightforward comparisons between 2 companies
  * "What did the CEO say about X?"

- **"detailed"** - Complex, analytical questions requiring comprehensive research and multiple data points:
  * Questions asking to "analyze", "comment on", "explain", "evaluate", "assess"
  * Questions about financial statement analysis (balance sheet, cash flow, debt structure, capital allocation)
  * Multi-company comparisons (3+ companies)
  * Questions asking for "breakdown", "details", "comprehensive", "usage", "strategy", "rationale"
  * Questions requiring synthesis of multiple data sources
  * "How" and "Why" questions requiring deep analysis
  * Questions about trends over multiple periods
  * Industry analysis questions
  * Executive leadership/strategy questions

**deep_search:** ONLY when user EXPLICITLY requests exhaustive/thorough/deep search
  * User explicitly says: "search thoroughly", "dig deep", "exhaustive search", "find everything"
  * User explicitly asks to "search harder" or "look more carefully"
  * User asks for "all mentions" or "complete list" of something specific
  * **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use deep_search by default - only when explicitly requested
  * **Default to "detailed" for complex questions unless user explicitly asks for deeper search**

**Examples of answer_mode:**
- "What was AAPL revenue?" -> {{"answer_mode": "direct"}}
- "Tell me about AAPL's iPhone sales" -> {{"answer_mode": "standard"}}
- "Comment on Oracle's balance sheet and debt usage" -> {{"answer_mode": "detailed"}}
- "Analyze Microsoft's cloud strategy over the past year" -> {{"answer_mode": "detailed"}}
- "Compare revenue growth for AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL" -> {{"answer_mode": "detailed"}}
- "Search thoroughly for all mentions of AI investments" -> {{"answer_mode": "deep_search"}}
- "Dig deep and find everything about Oracle's subsidiaries" -> {{"answer_mode": "deep_search"}}

**CRITICAL:** Always include "answer_mode" in user_hints - DO NOT leave it out. If you're unsure, default to "standard".

**CONVERSATION CONTEXT - WHEN TO USE IT vs WHEN TO IGNORE IT**

USE conversation history for tickers when the question clearly refers to the prior discussion (no new company named):
- Trigger phrases: "those companies", "these companies", "all companies above", "their", "they", "them", "compare them", "same companies", "the companies we discussed", "all of them", "each of them", "both companies".
- Then: set extracted_tickers to ALL tickers from the conversation history. Do NOT output extracted_tickers: [] when the question clearly refers to prior companies.

IGNORE conversation history when the user is asking about a different company or a fresh question:
- User explicitly names a different company: e.g. "What about $WMT?", "Now do Costco", "Same for $DIS?", "Switch to $PG" -> use only the company they are asking about now (e.g. ["WMT"], ["COST"], ["DIS"], ["PG"]). Do not carry over tickers from the previous conversation.
- Standalone question with a new $TICKER or company name in the current message -> extract only from the current question. Conversation context does not matter.
- When the question could be either "about the same companies" or "about a new company": if a specific new company is named ($TICKER or name), treat it as a new request and use that ticker; if only pronouns/back-references appear, use the history.

EXAMPLES (USE history):
- QUESTION: "Compare latest quarter of all companies mentioned above" + CONVERSATION had $TGT, $WMT, $COST -> extracted_tickers: ["TGT", "WMT", "COST"]
- QUESTION: "What was their revenue?" + CONVERSATION had $NFLX -> extracted_tickers: ["NFLX"]

EXAMPLES (IGNORE history - different or new company):
- QUESTION: "What about Kroger's margins?" or "$KR margins?" + CONVERSATION had $TGT, $WMT -> extracted_tickers: ["KR"] (user switched to a different company)
- QUESTION: "How did Disney do in Q3?" + CONVERSATION had $NFLX -> extracted_tickers: ["DIS"] (user is now asking about Disney, not Netflix)

FOLLOW-UP "THE SAME ABOUT X" - use conversation for TOPIC, new company for TICKERS:
- QUESTION: "Would you say the same about $DIS?" + CONVERSATION: User asked "What is the biggest risk to $NFLX?", Assistant answered about competition/content costs -> extracted_tickers: ["DIS"], topic: "biggest risk, risk factors"
- QUESTION: "What about Costco's operating margins?" + CONVERSATION: User asked "What were Target's operating margins?" -> extracted_tickers: ["COST"], topic: "operating margins"""
